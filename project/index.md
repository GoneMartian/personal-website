Experiment coding was done by me but this project was only possible through my dear teammates: Serengeti Ayhan, Verda Pınar, Zeynep Büşra Ayar, Ece Kızıltepe. It contains all the stimuli that were used. The stimuli was singed by Ece Naz Ertunç. Below you can read our Presentation Poster.

# Remembering Through Melodies: Effects of Melodical Presentation on Memory
#### Serengeti Ayhan, Arda Arslanbakan, Verda Pınar, Zeynep Büşra Ayar, Ece Kızıltepe
## Introduction
  Purnell-Web and Speelman (2008) found that rhythm can improve the recall of information, with or without musical accompaniment.
Music is known to evoke emotions in the listeners (Koneĉhi, 2008) and emotions are known to affect memory (Levine & Pizarro, 2004). Kuperman and his colleagues found that words can also affect memory. Whatever the word is positive or negative in a lexical sense can affect the recall rate (Kuperman et al., 2014).
Our research uses novel melodies and pseudo-words to study melody and rhythm free from interference. Our hypothesis is that there is a difference in recall rate between melodic and non-melodic presenting of information.
## Methods
### Participants 
  The participants were required to have normal or corrected vision, normal or corrected hearing, and be native Turkish speakers. The sample size was 24 (15 female, 9 male, median=20.5 years, range=9), and all participants were middle SES Turkish citizens. The participants were recruited through social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Twitter, and Instagram.

### Materials
  The conditions of the study were verbal information of two kinds: melodically presented or presented as flat speech. Both the melodic and non-melodic conditions had five sets of words consisting of five pseudowords either sung or spoken by the same voice, the example is given in Figure 1. The upper limit for all the pseudowords was four syllables. The order of groups (Melodic and Non- Melodic) and stimuli within the groups were randomized.

### Procedure
  All the participants were exposed to both conditions. The participants accessed the experiment through the link we provided. They filled in a demographic form. Then in the experiment, they listened to the pseudowords, while also seeing them on the screen one by one. After listening to both sets, the participants completed a distraction task consisting of basic mathematical questions. At the end of the distraction task, they were asked to type in all the words they remembered in any order.
  
### Results
  As seen in Figure 2, the mean number of melodic words remembered by the participants was 2.68 ( SD=1.937), and it was 2.00 for the non-melodic words (SD=1.773 ). There was no difference between memory performance for melodically and non-melodically presented words ( t(21)=1.611, p>0.05). There was no significant difference between sexes for melodic (t(21)=1.861, p=>0.05) and non-melodic words (t(21)= 0.239, p>0.05). The correlation between years of musical education and melodic word recall seen in Figure 3 was also not significant (r= -0.322, p>0.05).
